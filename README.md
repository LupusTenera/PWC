I am planning to use Google Firebase as database.
This will create a database and also regulate the login system.
I will work at 2 subjects at the same time so I can ask my tutor tommorow about how I could connect it.
Google Firebase use Json which is able to connect with C++.
So I will create the basic nodes with Json and regulate the processes with C++.
I am further planning to work this week at the front end.

Currently I am working to implement Felgo.
When I am finished I will work on Google firebase.

I configured Felgo for iOs although I am searching for a way to make it also compatible with android.

Discussed 15-10 with the teacher from college that the assesment might be too time consuming for the period I have.
Although I might could do a sub part .
28-10 meeting with teacher.
So far I made already the data structure , overview of pointers (although I need to finish the list, paired almost each value to a pointer), overview of a database etc. 

Doubting if I should just code the way I think it should be , waiting advice teacher/hearing that I need to do another assesment, thinking about an additional part for the app (which is smaller so more time realistic).
