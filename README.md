I am planning to use Google Firebase as database.
This will create a database and also regulate the login system.
I will work at 2 subjects at the same time so I can ask my tutor tommorow about how I could connect it.
Google Firebase use Json which is able to connect with C++.
So I will create the basic nodes with Json and regulate the processes with C++.
I am further planning to work this week at the front end.

Currently I am working to implement Felgo.
When I am finished I will work on Google firebase
